This is our repository for the Turtle Bot 2 competition.

Only push your src code folder. DO not uplaod devel folder

- reactive control, unable to adapt to anything so doesn't make sense (ex) random walk)
- for example we hard coded to only rotate 30 degrees, which causes it to miss halways etc.
- doesn't really make sense to do this, it will never be good enough to cover all the cases of the environment

- deliberative control is bad because you don't sense the goal. WE also are skeptical of how well the sensors are so we don't want to
plan based on the sensors

- We will likely use hybrid and behaviour based control
- we will tell it how it can act based on all the behaviours required to uncover the maze
